The research team creates surveys that contain short and long answer questions that allow us to gather quantitative and qualitative data on families' experiences with our program. In addition to surveys, we hold focus groups to gather more in-depth and personalized <em>feedback from families. </em> </p>

                    <p>Waterford encourages building a community between school and home through Waterford Family Academy, a service that delivers professional learning sessions to families. Families are provided with resources and advice on how to best support their students participating in Waterford Upstart in these learning sessions. The research team helped to ensure that Waterford Family Academy was beneficial to families by inviting families to sign up for focus groups to share their experiences after they participated in the program. Survey results from Waterford Family Academy have revealed positive experiences with the program in enhancing family engagement.</p>

                <p> We have utilized surveys to create and validate the CARES rubric which is based on the themes of Communication, Academic Content, Relationships, Expectations, and Support. Through surveys and parent interviews, these themes were identified as the ones that meant the most to families for their child's education. Pictured are the average ratings that families gave the 2022-2023 Upstart program on each of the themes of the CARES rubric.</p>

Waterford Upstart has been the best educational experience and I am truly grateful for it.”</p>

This program was amazing and the staff that run it and communicate with us families were phenomenal. My oldest daughter absolutely loved the interactive program and learned so much. She is above her grade level now and I want to say that Waterford was a big part of that.”</p>
